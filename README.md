Various scripts for editing Leaguepedia.

## Archive
See https://github.com/RheingoldRiver/leaguepedia_archive for old stuff that is not in use anymore. Code there may be simpler/have less dependencies, since much of it was one-time-use stuff that wouldn't have been built around doing stuff properly.

## Use
The contents of this repository are not intended to be used by third parties, and maintenance/stability is not guaranteed. If you do want to use stuff here, you will certainly need my mwclient wrapper: https://github.com/RheingoldRiver/mwcleric You may also need my validator: https://github.com/RheingoldRiver/leaguepedia_validation

See those repos for installation instructions.
